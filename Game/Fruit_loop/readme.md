# Fruit Loops 🍎🥨

A terminal-based adventure game where you navigate a hazardous grid, collect fruit, avoid lava, and manage explosives to reach the exit. Built as a modular Python package.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or higher (The project uses modern type hinting and structural pattern matching).

### Installation
Download this project folder.

Ensure your directory structure looks like this:
```text

FruitLoopsProject/
├── main.py           # The game launcher
└── Fruit_loop/       # The source package
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── game.py       # Main game loop
    ├── grid.py       # Map and wall logic
    ├── player.py     # Movement logic
    └── pickups.py    # Item and trap logic
```    
### Running the Game
You can run the game from the root directory (FruitLoopsProject/) using either of these methods:
#### Method A: Running as a Module
python -m Fruit_loop.game

#### Method B:Using the Launcher (Recommended)
python main.py

## 🎮 How to Play

### Controls
### W / A / S / D: Move Up, Left, Down, or Right.

**B: Place a Bomb (explodes in 3 moves).**

**I: View your current Inventory.**

**P: List the fruits you have collected.**

**Q / X: Quit the game.**

## Game Mechanics
- **The Floor is Lava: Every step costs 1 point and leaves a lava trail (~).**

- **Lava Damage: Stepping back into existing lava costs 5 points.**

- **Fruit Salad: Collecting fruit (O) grants 20 points.**

- **Grace Period: After picking up an item, you get 5 steps of "Free Move" protection where no points are deducted for movement or hazards.**

- **Traps (X): Stepping on a trap costs 10 points. Traps stay on the board!**

- **Chests & Keys: Find a Key (K) to unlock a Chest (C) for a 100-point treasure.**

- **Fertile Soil: Every 25 moves, a new fruit randomly sprouts on the map.**

- **The Exit (E): Collect all 7 initial items to unlock the exit and win the game.**

## 🛠️ Technical Details

**Modular Structure:** This project is organized as a formal Python package to demonstrate clean architecture:

**Absolute Imports:** Used throughout to ensure the package is portable.

**Encapsulation:** Game state (score, inventory, move counts) is managed within the play_game() function scope to avoid global variable conflicts.

**Grid Logic:** Walls are generated using for loops in grid.py to create contiguous obstacles without creating unreachable areas.

### Development with PyCharm
- To set up a Run Configuration:

- Go to Edit Configurations.

- Select Module Name instead of Script Path.

- Enter Fruit_loop.game.

- Set the Working Directory to the root project folder (the parent of Fruit_loop).

## 📝 Planned Improvements (Version 3 Tasks)
[ ] AI Enemies: Implement 1-3 enemies with pathfinding logic.

[ ] Jump Command: Implement J + WASD for two-step movement.

[ ] Shovel Item: Add a tool to destroy specific wall segments.

[ ] Trap Disarm: Add the T command to safely remove traps.

[ ] TDD: Implement unit tests for movement and scoring logic using pytest.
